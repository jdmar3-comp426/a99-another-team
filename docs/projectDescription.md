## Project concept: cookie clicker

The project is based on a cookie clicker game. Users, after signing in, will try to get the highest possible number of clicks (of a cookie) within a defined countdown time. The user with the highest score has the max score displayed on the leaderboard, and users will be able to access individual score and login history.
